# Cat Breed Chooser

![Cat Breed Chooser](./planning/CatBreedChooserSite.png)

As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on and on, the familiar surroundings of home and hearth become - well - *_too_* familiar. After being trapped inside and not able to socialize because heath is valuable, a person must adjust the familiar and implement new socialization strategies. The acquisition of a new pet is a necessity. And that new pet should be a cat.<br>

The pet options really boil down to choosing either a cat or a dog. A dog might be tempting, but dogs require outdoor exercise. Going outdoors means exposing your precious health to the disease-ridden, unwashed masses of unknown vaccination status. Cats do not require outdoor exercise and therefore do not require you to put your health at risk on a daily basis. Both a cat and a dog will provide a welcome change the familiar, but only a cat will allow you to stay safe and healthy inside your dwelling.<br>

The purpose of this project is to assist people with deciding which breed of cat would be best for them.<br><br>
