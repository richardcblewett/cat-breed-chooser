# Cat Breed Chooser

![Cat Breed Chooser](./planning/CatBreedChooserSite.png)

As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on and on, the familiar surroundings of home and hearth become - well - *_too_* familiar. After being trapped inside and not able to socialize because heath is valuable, a person must alter the familiar and implement new socialization strategies. The acquisition of a pet is a necessity. And that pet should be a cat.<br>

The pet options really boil down to choosing either a cat or a dog. A dog might be tempting, but dogs require outdoor exercise. Going outdoors means exposing your precious health to the disease-ridden, unwashed masses of unknown vaccination status. Cats do not require outdoor exercise and therefore do not require you to put your health at risk on a daily basis. Both a cat and a dog will provide a welcome change the familiar, but only a cat will allow you to stay safe and healthy inside your dwelling.<br>

The purpose of this project is to assist people with deciding which breed of cat would be best for them.

# Design

My original design for the side was to have a header with a navigation area on the left that dropped down into a left-side column.<br>

As I got further into the project I realized that while the original design would work great on a standard website, having a responsive mobile layout would be more difficult to implement.<br>

I pivoted to a simpler site that has essentially the same layout whether the user is on a traditional computer or a mobile device. <br>

I chose bootstrap as a CSS framework because I am interested in learning more about bootstrap and because it offers some built-in responsiveness. However, I also spiced the project with some vanilla CSS in places where I didn't want to use the default bootstrap options.
